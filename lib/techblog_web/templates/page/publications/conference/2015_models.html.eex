  <h3>UmpleRun: a Dynamic Analysis Tool for Textually Modeled State Machines using Umple</h3>
  <p class="abstract">
  In this paper, we present a tool named UmpleRun that allows modelers to run the textually specified state machines under analysis with an execution scenario to validate the model's dynamic behavior. In addition, trace specification will output execution traces that contain model construct links. This will permit analysis of behavior at the model level. Keywordsâ€” UmpleRun; Umple; UML; MOTL; state machine; execution trace; analysis.
