  <h3>Teaching UML Using Umple: Applying Model-Oriented Programming in the Classroom</h3>
  <p class="abstract">
    We show how a technology called Umple can be used to improve teaching UML and modeling. Umple allows UML to be viewed both textually and graphically, with updates to one view reflected in the other. It allows UML concepts to be added to programming languages, plus web-based code generation from UML to those languages. We have used Umple in student laboratories and assignments for two years, and also live in the classroom. In a survey, students showed enthusiasm about Umple, and indicated they believe it helps them understand UML better. Improvements in their grades also support our approach.
