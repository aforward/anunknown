  <h3>Perceptions of Software Modeling: A Survey of Software Practitioners </h3>
  <p class="abstract">
    In this paper we analyze the results of survey of how, when and why some software developers model, as well why many prefer not to model. The survey of 113 software practitioners studied the reasons developers chose code-centric versus model-centric software engineering, and also gathered data about the notations and tools used. Key findings include: UML is confirmed as the dominant modeling notation; modeling tools are primarily used to create documentation and for up-front design with little code generation; and modeling tools are also used to transcribe models from other media including whiteboards. The type and quality of generated code is one of the biggest reported problems.
