  <h3>Improving Program Comprehension by Enhancing Program Constructs: An analysis of the Umple language</h3>
  <p class="abstract">
    Umple is a set of extensions to existing object-oriented languages (currently PHP and Java) that provides a concrete syntax for UML abstractions like associations as well as certain software patterns. Umple, we argue, will help increase software program comprehension by allowing developers to describe a system at a more abstract level, and also by significantly reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and later understood.
