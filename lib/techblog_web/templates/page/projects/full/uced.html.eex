      <h1>Use Case Editor</h1>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://eecs.uottawa.ca/~ssome/Use_Case_Editor_UCEd.html" class="external">Use Case Editor</a> integrates a set of tools for use cases edition, domain model edition and
        requirements simulation. Based on use cases and a domain model description, UCEd generates a
        state model that realizes the use case.

        Dr. Forward was the lead designer building a Use Case Editor with Dr. Stephane Som√© at the University of
        Ottawa to development, maintain and simulate a user case domain model.  The project was built using
        Java and SWT user interface library.  The application was tested using JUnit and built using Ant.
