![git rebase -i HEAD~25 slide 01](/anunknown/assets/static/images/gitrebase_webcampzg/gitrebase.001.png?raw=true)

WebCamp Zagreb finished up last week.  Here's a
review of my talk on time travel and git rebase.

Once the videos are ready, I'll post a link here.

Thank you to the organizing committee of Web Camp Zagreb,
everything was amazing.
